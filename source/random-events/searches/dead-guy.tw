:: dead-guy

The wanderer studies the corpse that they've found. 

Its back is up against a tree; the previous owner seems to have died of exhaustion. 
And not too long ago by the looks of it.
Havan pecks at its [[bag|dg-bag]].

:: dg-bag

The wanderer does an inventory:
Some hard tack.
A slightly-shriveled apple. 
.36 caliber revolver ammo? Score!
Razor.
Small bag containing a small amount of white powder.
At least a hundred dollars?
