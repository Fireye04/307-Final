# Wander GDD

## Elevtor pitch

Wander vast lands discovering friends, enemies and perhaps even a reason why you're doing this in the first place.

## Setting

Wild west.

## Mechanics

### Enduring

Every night the wanderer is faced with crippling nightmares and the choice of whether to endure them or relent to them

This game intends to push the player towards relenting; full endurance should be difficult but not impossible. 

Relenting brings these living nightmares into the real world. Enduring keeps the real world mostly fine, albeit still a bit haunted.

Enduring = easy now, bad long term
Relending = difficult now, good long term

How do I make relenting as bad for the player as it is for the wanderer? (wanderer gets tortured, player gets cookies [more story]. Bad incentive structure)
- Mechanical debuffs!

Relenting gives a debuff that will get worse with every subsequent day you've relented resetting when the player has endured one time. (in order to de-incentivise JUST relenting, because that's also boring!) Each time, the debuff is reset a little bit smaller than it was before, and scales up slower to signify the wanderer moving through their grief and guilt.  

Enduring is easy short term and lets the wanderer focus on their travels and encounters, however pushes them closer to a bad ending. As the player endures more, its efficacy reduces little by little with each subsequent use, the nightmares slowly working their way through the barrier.

If the player endures X times, they break through and the wanderer has a full on mental breakdown :3

Further, at certain thresholds of endurance counts, an endurance debuff will be applied and increased, applying only when endurance is taken, but not resetting, to signify the nightmares breaking though the defenses. 

### Weather

Two weather states will be added to improve immersion and worldbuilding. Each day one will be selected, and will affect various descriptions, and perhaps events as well. 

### Story told through random events

Events need some sort of throughline! The wanderer's ghosts serve to do so very well. 

Each NPC gets a pool of random events that occur at camp linearly, and a couple that can trigger after their storyline is exhausted.

Actual story beats are a function of days passed and Endurance count. Could also make it a function of which characters have been completed up to that point.
