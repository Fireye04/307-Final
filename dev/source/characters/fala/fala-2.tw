"No, Mac! Have you lost your damned mind?!" 
Fala paced around camp, her barely contained frustration apparent. 
"We're not letting some common street thief..." she sputtered.

"'Ey I'll have you know the kid practically paid fer that sandwitch 'an then some! They're practically a wizard with a hammer..."

"After a couple lessons" Mac whispered, turning to them with a [[wink|mac-wink]]. 

:: fala-wink

They giggled, recalling the numerous misses and fingers slammed along the way. 

All in all though, they had truthfully saved Mac a significant amount of laborous work, 
and they could tell the man enjoyed his time much more throughout;
He was a very natural teacher.

Fala opened and closed her mouth making various noises in frustration.
She had been travelling with Mac for long enough to genuinely care about him, 
and to her dismay she could see how much having the child around had [[improved his spirits|mac-spirits]].

:: fala-spirits

"Fuuuuuuuck" she finally exhaled. 
She stomped up to Mac, his bearded face molded to his signature grin.

"Listen here. If you really want to take this child away from their home and put them in harm's way, I guess I can't stop you, but we're doing this MY way, do you hear?"

"Yes ma'am!" Mac shouted gleefully, throwing a playful salute.

Fala exhaled forcefully, massaging her temples with her left hand.

"And you." She turned to Them. "One wrong move and you're [[out of here|mac-outta-here]], you understand?"

:: fala-outta-here

They nodded vigorously. 

"And you understand what you're getting into? Mac and I live off the land. The creature comforts of society can be completely forgotten. You will pull your weight, or we drop you at the next town."

More nodding.

"Very well. There is a stream a quarter mile due west. Take that bucket, and return with water for camp."

"[[Yes ma'am|fala-yes-maam]]" They sqeaked.

:: fala-yes-maam

As They scurried away to grab the water They heard one last exchange between the two.

"Don't ever say I don't do anything for you." Fala.

"Thank you. They just remind me so much of Adam." Mac.

"I can tell." Fala.

They looked back at the two before leaving the clearing: 
Mac had wrapped Fala in a big bear hug.
He spotted Their glance and made a thumbs up followed by a shooing motion.
