"They're here" Fala's quiet but urgent whisper pierced Their dreams like a skewer. 
In all the years they had travelled together, he had only heard that tone of urgency a handful of times, and only in the most dire of circumstances. 

They quickly exited Their tent and began to gather Their things in the early morning's darkness, when they felt Fala grab Their shoulders. 
"No time. [[We go now|fala-now]]". 

Their pack would have to suffice.

"How did they..."

"I don't know. I just need you to get on Neal with Mac right now."

Mac was already sitting atop Neal, his hand outstretched. 
They grabbed it and were hoisted up in front of him.

"[[Going Somewhere|fala-somewhere]]?" A cocky voice called out through the night.

"Don't bother. We've got you surrounded." 
A man on horseback, holding a gun and a flickering lantern moved into the clearing.
Fala was nowhere to be seen.
"Pinkerton Detective Agency. Y'all are under arrest for the murder of Buck Calhoun."

"You two, Get off the horse and put your hands on your-- AAAAAAUGHHHHHHH" 
The man screamed as an arrow sprouted from his eye.

Mac spurred on Neal, [[rocketing|fala-rocketing]] out of the clearing.

The two of them kept riding as long as they could, long after they had lost their trail.
"You're bleeding" Noted Mac, gesturing at the bullet hole in their left arm.

"Didn't notice." They muttered.

Mac pulled Neal to a stop, and tried to get off. 
His rear leg caught the saddle, sending the stout man tumbling to the ground. 

He was bleeding. A lot.
"No, no no no nonono" They lept off Neal, desperately wrapping wounds in whatever clothing was handy. 

"Hey, hey." Mac wheezed. 
"It's too late fer me, kiddo. You're all that mattered. To either of us. Keep going, will ya?"

"Stop with that shit, you're making it, you're making it, you hear me?"

Mac chuckled silently, that grin on his face to the last.

"<<link "Eat a sandwitch" $returnAddress>><</link>> for me."
