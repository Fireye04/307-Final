Lightning crackles across the sky.

The nightly screams 
assault 
the wanderer's mental fortress 
once again.

[[They Endure|endure]]
[[They Relent|relent]]

:: endure
<<set window.setIsEnduring(true)>>
Their focus redoubles as the walls are pommeled 
again 
and again, 
grimacing with each subsequent impact.

And moment by moment the wanderer endures,
slowly but surely 
making it 
[[through the night|wake]].

:: relent
<<set window.setIsEnduring(false)>>
Exhausted, they lower their barriers,
allowing the voices
to rush inside. 

They collapse 
backwards 
as 
the screams 
begin 
to tear 
them 
to shreds 
once again.
[[As they deserve|wake]].
