The wanderer wakes in their tent exhausted.

<<set $weather = getWeather(["sunny"])>>
<<if $weather === "rainy">>The sag in the roof of their tent and steady 
"drip, 
drip, 
drip" of water suggest that it had rained the night before.

"Shit" they mutter as they get dressed, their clothes soaked from the water that had poured in the tent entrance. 
They'd have to remember to dig a moat around their tent next time<<if not $endured>>, 
like Mac had always told them. 

With a shaky sigh, they [[exit the tent|camp]]<<else>>. 
They shoulder aside the entrance flap and [[exit the tent|camp]] with a sigh<</if>>.
<<elseif $weather === "sunny">>The first rays of sun 
creep in 
through a crack in the entrance, casting the hazy shadow of a tree branch on the wall opposite. 
<<if not $endured>>The shadow reminds them of Vivian. 
She was always the early riser. 
They could still hear the echoes of her calling them to wake up through the tent's entrance.
<</if>>
"Nice day out" they muse as they get dressed.
