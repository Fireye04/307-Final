The wanderer wakes in their tent exhausted.
<<if $currentWeather === "rainy">>The sag in the roof of their tent and steady 
drip, 
drip, 
drip
of water suggest that it had rained the night before.

"Shit" they mutter as they get dressed, their clothes soaked from the water that had poured in the tent entrance. 
They'd have to remember to dig a moat around their tent tomorrow<<if not $endured>>, 
like [[Mac]] had always told them. 

With a shaky sigh, they [[exit the tent|start-camp]]<<else>>. 

They shoulder the entrance flap aside and [[exit the tent|start-camp]] with a sigh<</if>>.
<<elseif $currentWeather === "sunny">>The first rays of sun 
creep in 
through a crack in the entrance, 
casting the hazy shadow of a tree branch on the wall opposite.<<if not $endured>>

The shadow reminds them of [[Fala]], standing just outside the tent as she used to.

They get dressed with a sigh and [[make their way out of the tent|start-camp]]<<else>>

"Nice day out" they muse as they get dressed then [[exit the tent|start-camp]]

Havan, their raven, studies them quizzically. <<linkappend "They pet Havan">>
The raven closes its eyes gratefully as the wanderer provides mandatory chin scritches.<</linkappend>>

Time to pack up.
