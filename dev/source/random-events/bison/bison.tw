/*the wanderer finds a slaughtered buffalo */

:: bison

/*TODO: weather states*/
The wanderer spots a vulture.

"Vultures are nature's guides" the wanderer muses to Themselves.

The wanderer gestures Neal forward, following the vulture in their [[solitary silence|bison-continue]].

:: bison-continue

The vulture settles down on a rotting bison carcass. 

The wanderer reaches into their saddle bag taking out a small, carved wooden bison, 
feeling the grooves in its side in an attempt to calm themselves down.<<if $enduring is false>>

"You're no better than them" Fala whispers.

The wanderer grits their teeth. "You disrespect her memory," They respond.<</if>>

They dismount to [[study the thing|bison-study]], scattering the vultures

:: bison-study

Several bullet holes <<linkappend "pepper its side.">> 
Careless, imprecise shots. The animal died in great pain.
<</linkappend>>
The pelt remained on the beast, its state far too degraded to be of any use or value.
A large gaping hole yawns from the beast's <<linkappend "skull">>
Shotgun. Point blank or very close range. 
Likely how the pained creature was put out of its misery.
<<linkappend "The horns are missing">>
Taken as prizes, no doubt.
<</linkappend>><</linkappend>>
Liquid blood still pooled <<linkappend "around the beast.">>
A day old, maybe less. Their grip on the carving tightens.<<if $enduring is false>>

"Pretender. Unworthy abandoner." Fala jeers at them. 
The wanderer takes a deep breath and concentrates trying to cast her voice out of their brain.
It is not effective.<</if>>

They look around. A plume of smoke [[rises|bison-rise]], about an hour's ride due northwest.
<</linkappend>>

:: bison-rise

Neal makes short work of the journey. 
They could've tracked the bastards just fine without the smoke, due to the littered trail of bison they saw along the way.
They could feel their blood pressure rise with each additional corpse.

The off-key drunken voices singing get louder [[as they approach|bison-approach]]. 

:: bison-approach

The camp is haphazard. 
A bonfire far larger than necessary, a half-set up tent, and bottles of liquor littered everywhere.

They dismount Neal, and approach the singers. 
They count four.

"Excuse me." The wanderer interrupts. 
No response; the singing continues.

They sigh, drawing their revolver and [[firing once|bison-fire]] in the air.

:: bison-fire

The group shuts up fast.
"Where the fuck did you come from?" One shouts.

"Pardon the interruption, did you happen to kill those bison?"

"Yeah! They're offering two bucks a horn if you want in." boasts one, before getting ruthlessly elbowed by his friend.
"Remus! Shut the fuck up!" The other looks up at the wanderer, a phony smile on his lips.
"Sorry, what's it to you?"

<<if $enduring is false>>
[[Shoot them|bison-shoot]]
[[Spare them|bison-fala-spare]]
<<else>>
[[Shoot them|bison-shoot]]
[[Spare them|bison-spare]]
<</if>>

:: bison-shoot

<<set $bisonShot to true>>
Four shots echo over the plains.<<if $enduring is false>>

The wanderer feels a hand on their shoulder. Fala.

"Well done." She says simply. 

A tear rolls down their cheek. 
"I miss you."

"[[I know|bison-cleanup]]." She responds.<<else>>

The wanderer studies the scene. 
Havan had flown to the open can of beans one had been eating, and had begun to pick at it.

They sighed. [[Time to clean up|bison-cleanup]].<</if>>


:: bison-cleanup

They took awhile to loot and gather the various items into a sufficiently burnable pile. 

But finally, it was done. 
They set it off, and spurred Neal off to wander once again, looking for a good place to set up camp.

The day's exhaustion had <<link "caught up" $returnAddress>><</link>> with them.

:: bison-spare

<<set $bisonShot to false>>

"I'm going to say this once. I have five shots left in this gun. That's one for each of you, and I even get a spare in case I miss." 
They pause.
"I don't miss."

They click the hammer into position.
"Here's what I need from you, to maybe prevent anything unfortunate from happening." 

They gesture at the closest one.
"You, bring me the horns you've gathered up to this point. And everyone else, get a nice blunt object."

They flashed a skeletal smile "[[We're going hammering|bison-hammering]]"

:: bison-hammering

The sobs of lost capital and clacking of rocks on bone went on for a while.
And finally, when no horns remained intact, the wanderer mounted Neal and took their leave to find a good spot to set up camp.

The day's exhaustion had <<link "caught up" $returnAddress>><</link>>. with them.

:: bison-fala-spare

<<set $bisonShot to true>>

The wanderer takes a deep breath and lowers their weapon. 
They feel a hand grip theirs.

They turn.
Fala.

"Traitor." She says, wrenching the gun from their hands, placing a shot squarely in each of the men's foreheads.
She hands back the gun, her anger apparent. 

They take it, jaw clenched. "They didn't deserve to die"

"Oh? Were any of their lives any more valuable than those of the bison they killed? Or were to kill?"

The wanderer [[remains silent|bison-cleanup]].
